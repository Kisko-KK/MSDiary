# MSDiary - Web application for keeping a diary of watched movies and series

## Overview



MSDiary is a web application designed to serve as a diary for keeping track of watched movies and series. As part of my final thesis, this project was developed to explore the practicality and effectiveness of using modern web technologies for organizing and managing personal entertainment preferences.

The application allows users to create accounts, log in securely using Firebase Authentication, and maintain a personalized diary of watched movies and series. Users can search for titles, add them to their diary, rate and review them, and mark their progress as they watch.
